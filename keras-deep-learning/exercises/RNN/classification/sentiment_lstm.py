"""sentiment_lstm.py
This program will classify reviews from IMDB based on sentiment, positive or negative.
We will used the IMDB database that comes with Keras.
This data has already preprocessed the reviews.
This pre processing replaces the actual works with the encoding.  So the second most
popular word is replaced by 2, third most popular by 3, etc.
